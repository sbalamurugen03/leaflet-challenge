The earthquake data was retrieved from USGS 

	https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php (Past 7 Days --> All Earthquakes)
	https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

Markers with size corresponding to earthquake magnitude

A legend showing the depth and their corresponding color

Data points scale with magnitude level 

Data points colors change with depth level 

Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth 

All data points load in the correct locations 

The app is deployed to the static github page. https://sbalamurugen03.github.io/leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Part-1/
